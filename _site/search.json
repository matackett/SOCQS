    "text": "Abstract\nTo increase diversity and representation in statistics and in STEM at large, it is essential that students can envision themselves as contributing members of these fields. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the student experience in introductory classes, as it is there that students first assess whether they can successfully pursue a particular major or career. In this session, we will present results from research on undergraduate students’ sense of community and belonging in in-person, hybrid, and online introductory math and statistics courses. We will provide a brief overview of the project that started in Fall 2020, describe the survey instrument and focus group protocol used for data collection, and present results including classroom practices associated with a higher sense of community. Participants will have the opportunity to share their experiences and exchange ideas about what has worked to foster community and belonging in their own courses.\nLink to eCOTS 2022 program."

Click on a large rectangle (e.g., “Relationship to Peers”) to drill into it, narrowing your frame of reference to that theme and its subthemes. Subthemes which can be drilled into further are indicated with an asterisk (e.g., “Relationship to Peers|Personal Identity*). After drilling down, click on the up arrow (&#8593) in the upper-right-corner of the map to return up a level.\n\nThe interactive tree map was developed by Sarwari Das as part of the SOCQS project led by Maria Tackett and Shira Viel. This research was conducted under Duke University Campus IRB(Protocol #2021-0050) and supported by Duke Learning Innovation’s Carry the Innovation Forward program. Data were gathered from a series of 5 focus groups conducted with a total of 12 students. Transcripts were coded in NVivo.\nThe authors would like to thank Duke Learning Innovation, particularly Kim Manturuk, for their support facilitating the focus groups and preparing the data, as well as former Research Assistant Margaret Poulos, who developed the focus group protocol."
