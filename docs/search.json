    "text": "The interactive tree map was developed by Sarwari Das as part of the SOCQS project led by Maria Tackett and Shira Viel. This research was conducted under Duke University Campus IRB(Protocol #2021-0050) and supported by Duke Learning Innovation’s Carry the Innovation Forward program. Data were gathered from a series of 5 focus groups conducted with a total of 12 students. Transcripts were coded in NVivo.\nThe authors would like to thank Duke Learning Innovation, particularly Kim Manturuk, for their support facilitating the focus groups and preparing the data, as well as former Research Assistant Margaret Poulos, who developed the focus group protocol."

    "text": "Abstract\nTo increase diversity and representation in statistics and in STEM at large, it is essential that students can envision themselves as contributing members of these fields. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the student experience in introductory classes, as it is there that students first assess whether they can successfully pursue a particular major or career. In this session, we will present results from research on undergraduate students’ sense of community and belonging in in-person, hybrid, and online introductory math and statistics courses. We will provide a brief overview of the project that started in Fall 2020, describe the survey instrument and focus group protocol used for data collection, and present results including classroom practices associated with a higher sense of community. Participants will have the opportunity to share their experiences and exchange ideas about what has worked to foster community and belonging in their own courses.\nLink to eCOTS 2022 program."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The SOCQS project, begun in Fall 2020, is a mixed-methods investigation of classroom community in introductory undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses. It is crucial to understand the student experience in this setting, as it is there that many students first assess whether they can successfully pursue a particular STEM major or career. The project’s goals are threefold:\n\nTo identify pedagogies, policies, and structures in introductory quantitative science courses which correlate with an increased sense of classroom community;  \nTo better understand how students in introductory quantitative science courses perceive and experience classroom community; and  \nTo analyze how these perceptions and experiences differ across a diverse population, including along demographic axes and different learning modalities and preferences. \n\n\nThis project is funded by the Carry the Innovation Forward Grant from Duke Learning Innovation."
