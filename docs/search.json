    "text": "Principal Investigators\n\nDr. Maria Tackett is an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. Her current work focuses on understanding how active learning strategies can be used to promote engagement and student motivation in undergraduate statistics courses. She also studies how classroom practices in introductory math and statistics courses impact students’ sense of community, self-efficacy, and learning outcomes. Maria is an RStudio certified trainer and is actively involved in the R and statistics education communities.\n\n\nDr. Shira Viel is an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of Mathematics at Duke University. She works primarily in introductory undergraduate mathematics education and is devoted to making math as welcoming and inclusive as possible. Current projects include investigating the impact of assessment and grading policies on Calculus students’ mathematical attitudes and perceptions; understanding students’ senses of community and self-efficacy in introductory quantitative science courses; and assessing the efficacy of math graduate student teacher training programs.\n\n\nResearch Assistants\n\nSarwari Das is a master’s candidate in Interdisciplinary Data Science in the Graduate School at Duke University. Her research work focuses on the intersection of behavior science and technology.\n\n\n\nPrevious Members\n\nJoe Choo (Spring 2022)\nMaggie Poulos (Summer - Fall 2021)"

    "text": "Abstract\nTo increase diversity and representation in statistics and in STEM at large, it is essential that students can envision themselves as contributing members of these fields. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the student experience in introductory classes, as it is there that students first assess whether they can successfully pursue a particular major or career. In this session, we will present results from research on undergraduate students’ sense of community and belonging in in-person, hybrid, and online introductory math and statistics courses. We will provide a brief overview of the project that started in Fall 2020, describe the survey instrument and focus group protocol used for data collection, and present results including classroom practices associated with a higher sense of community. Participants will have the opportunity to share their experiences and exchange ideas about what has worked to foster community and belonging in their own courses.\nLink to eCOTS 2022 program."

    "text": "The interactive tree map below is a hierarchical representation of themes from a series of focus groups conducted during the 2021-2022 school year with undergraduate students enrolled in introductory math and statistics courses at a private American University. The relative sizes of the rectangles in the tree map indicate the relative frequency of the themes in focus group discussion.\n\n\nThe interactive tree map was developed by Sarwari Das as part of the SOCQS project led by Maria Tackett and Shira Viel. This research was conducted under Duke University Campus IRB(Protocol #2021-0050) and supported by Duke Learning Innovation’s Carry the Innovation Forward program. Data were gathered from a series of 5 focus groups conducted with a total of 11 students. Transcripts were coded in NVivo.\nThe authors would like to thank Duke Learning Innovation, particularly Kim Manturuk, for their support facilitating the focus groups and preparing the data, as well as former Research Assistant Margaret Poulos, who developed the focus group protocol."

    "section": "",
    "text": "To increase diversity and representation in math and statistics and in STEM at large, it is essential that undergraduate students be able to envision themselves as contributing members of these fields. Students’ sense of belonging is a critical factor in their persistence, and more broadly their sense of community is correlated with academic motivation and perceived learning. \nThe SOCQS project, begun in Fall 2020, is a mixed-methods investigation of classroom community in introductory undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses. It is crucial to understand the student experience in this setting, as it is there that many students first assess whether they can successfully pursue a particular STEM major or career. The project’s goals are threefold:\n\nTo better understand how students in introductory quantitative science courses perceive and experience classroom community;\nTo analyze how these perceptions and experiences differ across a diverse population, including along demographic axes and different learning modalities and preferences; and\nTo identify pedagogies, policies, and structures in introductory quantitative science courses which correlate with an increased sense of classroom community.\n\n\nThis project is funded by the Carry the Innovation Forward Grant from Duke Learning Innovation."
